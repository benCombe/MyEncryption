While Season 2 will unfold in a traditional,
linear manner, Season 1 was presented to us
Dunkirk-style, with many not realizing that
we were following, essentially, three different
timelines, until the fourth episode, “Of
Banquets, Bastards and Burials,” made it more
clear. Ultimately though, the first season
focuses on the Big Three: Geralt of Rivia,
Yennefer of Vengerberg, and Cirilla (aka “Ciri”)
of Cintra. There are many important characters
in The Witcher, but these are the pillars.
